VIAG.RA -- The URL Lengthener

Viagra is a URL lengthener that I created because I'm sick of URL shorteners, they are popping up like cancer on the internet. And if one goes down you have a bunch of dead links.
So I wrote a url lengthener to counter this problem.  And I'm making it open source so that if the url ever goes down, people can still reverse engineer the links.
